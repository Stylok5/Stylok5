### Hi there, I'm Kostas  ðŸ‘‹

I am a Junior Software Engineer based in Athens and I recectly completed General Assembly's Software Engineering course, from November 2022 to May 2023.

I have experience working with: HTML | CSS | JavaScript | React | Node.js | Express.js | Python | Django | MongoDB | PostgreSQL

ðŸ”­ I recently started working on creating a file organiser using python, so that I can gain more experience with the language. Will be looking for a typescript, php and angular course to complete as well in the near future, to gain some additional knowledge.
